# Project 2


## Purpose of the project 
In this project, we enhanced our ability to add and commit changes in files to our git repo. We also wrote a function that returns a single, random, lowercase letter.

## Technologies used 
- Javascript
- VS Code
- GitHub

## What I learned from this Project 
During this lab, I learned... 
- How to refactor code
- To create functions getRandomLetter(), getRandomString(min, max), and getSortedString(string)
- The difference between function expressions and function declarations and how to turn one into the other
- What a .gitignore file does
- Hoisiting and how this differs between function expressions and declarations
